    <h1>My Reflection</h1>
    
    <h3>1. How would you describe this project and what is its purpose?</h3>
    <p>I'd describe this project as a good opportunity to learn about the computer science field. The purpose is to teach us so we can use it later on.</p>
    
    <h3>2. In what ways did this project contribute to your overall learning as a computer science student?</h3>
    <p>This project has made me deepen my understanding of HTML as I applied the concepts I learned into my own webpage.</p>
    
    <h3>3. How has this project been iteratively developed over time?</h3>
    <p>At first, I focused on the core HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and links. Then I improved my webpage by adding images and made sure everything was aligned correctly.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Looking back, what might you have done differently?</h3>
    <p>Something I could've done differently is planned the structure and layout before coding, making sure my project was polished and neat.</p>
    
    <h3>5. If you were to further develop this project, what would your next steps be?</h3>
    <p>Some further steps I'd take to make my webpage even better are adding different background colors to make it more engaging. I would also like to add smoother transitions, if that even exists.</p>
